# Coffee Shop Data Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains an Excel file (`Coffee_Shop Data Analysis.xlsx`) that includes data related to a coffee shop's customers, products, and orders. The data is organized into three sheets: **Customers**, **Products**, and **Orders**. This README provides an overview of the data structure and how to interpret the information in each sheet.

## File Structure

### 1. Customers Sheet
The **Customers** sheet contains information about the coffee shop's customers. The columns include:

- **Customer ID**: A unique identifier for each customer.  
- **Customer Name**: The name of the customer.  
- **City**: The city where the customer resides.  
- **Country**: The country of the customer (mostly United States, with some entries from Ireland and the United Kingdom).  
- **Loyalty Card**: Indicates whether the customer has a loyalty card (**Yes** or **No**).  

### 2. Products Sheet
The **Products** sheet lists the coffee products offered by the shop. The columns include:

- **Product ID**: A unique identifier for each product.  
- **Coffee Type**: The type of coffee (e.g., **Arabica, Robusta, Liberica, Excelsa**).  
- **Roast Type**: The roast level (**Light, Medium, Dark**).  
- **Size**: The size of the product in kilograms (e.g., **0.2, 0.5, 1, 2.5**).  
- **Unit Price**: The price per unit of the product.  
- **Price per 100g**: The price per 100 grams of the product.  
- **Profit**: The profit generated per unit of the product.  

### 3. Orders Sheet
The **Orders** sheet contains details about customer orders. The columns include:

- **Order ID**: A unique identifier for each order.  
- **Order Date**: The date the order was placed.  
- **Customer ID**: The ID of the customer who placed the order (links to the **Customers** sheet).  
- **Product ID**: The ID of the product ordered (links to the **Products** sheet).  
- **Quantity**: The number of units ordered.  
- **Total Profit**: The total profit generated from the order.  
- **Sales**: The total sales amount for the order.  

## How to Use the Data

- **Customer Analysis**: Use the **Customers** sheet to analyze customer demographics, such as the distribution of customers by city or country, and the percentage of customers with loyalty cards.  
- **Product Analysis**: The **Products** sheet can be used to analyze the profitability of different coffee types, roast levels, and sizes. You can also compare the unit prices and profit margins across products.  
- **Order Analysis**: The **Orders** sheet allows you to analyze sales trends over time, identify the most popular products, and calculate total revenue and profit generated from orders. You can also link the **Customer ID** and **Product ID** to the **Customers** and **Products** sheets for more detailed insights.  

## Example Queries

- **Top-Selling Products**: Identify the products with the highest sales by summing up the `Sales` column in the **Orders** sheet and grouping by **Product ID**.  
- **Customer Loyalty Analysis**: Compare the purchasing behavior of customers with and without loyalty cards by filtering the **Orders** sheet based on the **Loyalty Card** column in the **Customers** sheet.  
- **Profitability by Roast Type**: Calculate the total profit generated by each roast type by summing the `Total Profit` column in the **Orders** sheet and grouping by **Roast Type** from the **Products** sheet.  

## Notes

- The data is **fictional** and is intended for **analysis and practice purposes**.  
- Ensure that when linking data between sheets (e.g., **Customer ID** or **Product ID**), you use appropriate lookup functions (e.g., `VLOOKUP` or `INDEX-MATCH`) to combine data from different sheets.
